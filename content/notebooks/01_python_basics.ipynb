    "* A value is **assigned** to a variable using the **`=`** sign. \n",
    "* **Important:** unlike in mathematics, the `=` sign in python is directional: the variable name must\n",
    "  always be on the left of the `=`, and the value to assign to the variable on the right.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  a = 23    # Valid assignment.\n",
    "  8 = b     # NOT a valid assignment.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create a variable, python associates the variable name to a section of your computer's memory (i.e. the [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory)) which will contain the data for the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/var_simple.png\" alt=\"representation of a simple variable in memory\" style=\"width:150px;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, variables names must adhere to these restrictions:\n",
    "* Variable names must be **composed solely of uppercase and lowercase letters** (`A-Z`, `a-z`), \n",
    "  **digits** (`0-9`), and the **underscore** character `_`.\n",
    "* The **first character** of a variable name **cannot be a digit**.\n",
    "* By convention, **variable names starting with a single or double underscore `_`/`__` are reserved \n",
    "  for \"special\" variables** (class private attributes, \"magic\" variables).\n",
    "* Examples:\n",
    "    * `var_1` is a valid variable name.\n",
    "    * `1_var` is **not** a valid name (starts with a digit)\n",
    "    * `var-1` is **not** a valid name (contains a the non-authorized character `-`)\n",
    "    * `__var_1__` is valid, but **should not be used**, with the exception of very specific situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important tips**:\n",
    "* Using **explicit variable names makes your code easier to read** for others, and possibly yourself \n",
    "  in a not-so-distant future.  \n",
    "  E.g. `input_file` is better than `iptf`, even if it is a bit longer.\n",
    "* **Never use python built-in names as variable names**, otherwise you will overwrite this object in the \n",
    "  namespace.  \n",
    "  E.g., don't call a variable `str`, `int` or `list` (this can be painful to debug)."
